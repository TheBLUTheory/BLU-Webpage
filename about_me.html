        <h1>Who is BLU?</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Professionally, my name is Brandon Lu. My peers call me BLU based on my initials "BLu".
            I am naturally a very introverted person at heart.
            Because of this, it was very hard for me to make friends prior to high school.
            I was the type to conform to the social norms, to do everything that I thought society wanted me to do.
            I just wanted people to like me. 
        </p>
		<h3>Elementary School</h3>
		<p>This was my first journey in life. I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama. Everything was fine. I had friends.
            Nobody discriminated against each other. We saw each other as equals.
            We all knew each other and could comfortably talk to anyone in our entire grade.</p>
		<h3>Middle School</h3>
		<p>Middle school was the start of a miserable life for me.
            I had a few friends, but we were all immature.
            I tried to be a social person, but it isn't as easy at is seems.
            Middle school is the point in my life in which I learned about discrimination.
            Being one of the only few Asians in a predominantly white and black school made me an easy target for bullying.
            It didn't help that I was short, skinny, unathletic, not the best student, or have any talents.
            Add to that the level of immaturity of my peers, it was brutal.
        </p>
        <p>The bullying ranged from verbal, to physical, to emotional.
            Some kids would constantly racially harass me in the hallway.
            Some would push or smack me around knowing that I wouldn't do anything about it.
            Three kids in my class decided to publicly post to my facebook wall that I should kill myself for being Asian.
            I deleted the multiple posts of this content that they tried to upload.
            The next day in class, they told me that they were just joking.
            I told them it was fine, but I didn't tell them that I actually did contemplate taking my own life that day.
            I would go to adults, but it never helped.
            </p>
        <p>Adults who cared would call these bullies into their offices to talk to them, but that would never last.
            Some adults didn't care at all.
            One day in my Home Economics class, I told me peers that it was racist to always refer to me as "Asian" rather than my real name.
            My teacher, overhearing the conversation, told me that it wasn't racist to call someone Asian.
            I guess she just didn't care about the context.
        </p>
		<h3>Starting Fresh</h3>
		<p>By the end of my 7th grade year, I had had enough.
            I was depressed. I was suicidal.
            At this point, I was thinking about taking my own life every single day.
            One day, I sat in front of my laptop in tears as I wrote a letter explaining why I couldn't take this life anymore.
            I had looked up the most painless ways to end your own life.
            Thankfully, I never got myself to do it and found another solution.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving to Georgia</h3>
        <p>My oldest cousin Sean was attending the Georgia Institute of Technology around this time.
            This was one of the best universities in the nation for engineering.
            I already had an interest in programming and thtought that it would be a good career path.
            I asked my father to let me move to Georgia with the goal of getting accepted into Georgia Tech after high school.
            This was not a complete lie, but it was not the primary motive for moving.
            I wanted to move to escape the miserable life I had in Alabama.
            He agreed to let me live with his closest cousin's family in Duluth.
            In the fall of 2011, I had officially moved away from my parents to live with my uncle's family.
        </p>
        <h4>It wasn't an instant solution to my depression</h4>
        <p>
            Being the naturally introverted and socially awkward kid I grew up being, it was still hard to make friends.
            I was still too focused on pleasing others and trying to fit with the "social norms".
            Eventually I decided to make a big change.
            I decided to stop living for other people and just live to make myself happy.
            If people didn't like it, that was fine. At least I wasn't living a lie anymore.
            I guess that kind of energy just radiated.
            Being me definitely pushed people away, but it attracted the people who mattered.
            After I made this change, I found my place in school and I finally had genuine friends.
        </p>
        <h4>College</h4>
        <p>My first year was pretty hard. I was taking 17 credit hours which was more exhausting than I thought it would be.
            On top of that, I also had a part-time job that I would be working full-time every summer.
            Due to my family's financial situation, I had to work to support myself while they would struggle to help me in any way that they could.
            It took me way too long to realize how badly this was affecting my grades.
            My GPA fell semester after semester, eventually costing me my HOPE scholarship which would have made things so much easier on me and my family.
        </p>
        <p>This drove me back into my depression.
            I was so worried about my future.
            I worked so hard outside of school for money so that my parents didn't have to work as hard,
            but I only ended up making it much harder to make even more money in the future because I was far behind in school and in my programming skills.
            It was affecting my personality.
            It was affecting how I treated others.
            It was affecting my grades.
            It was affecting how I just generally handled things.
        </p>
        <p>After the second semester of my Junior year of college, my ex girlfriend motivated me to open up about things.
            I did. I opened up to my brother. He helped me create a plan to get my grades back up.
            They both constantly motivated me to do better and supported me throughout my struggles.
            It was a huge struggle.
        </p>
            My spring semester of 2018 was the most stressful one I had ever had to endure.
            But at the end, it was all worth it. My boss was very understanding and gave me time off to fully focus on school.
            For the first time in my college career, I had to take out student loans to support myself since I was no longer working and my family couldn't help me anymore.
            Also For the first time in my college career, I got nearly straight A's.
            I ended the semester with a 3.87 Term GPA and was named to the Dean's List.
            All of my friends were so proud of me, and I was so proud of myself.
        </p>
        <h4>The Job Hunt</h4>
        <p>At this point, I was much more proactive about finding another internship in the field of software development.
            I applied to over 40 jobs in the course of two months.
            I got four interviews in total, but was rejected by them all.
            I didn't even make it to an interview with the other jobs, some of them still have yet to respond to my application,
            but we can all assume what that means.
        </p>
        <p>Despite this, I'm not upset at all. Why?
            Of course I would much rather have an internship that pays me well so that I don't have to worry about my financial situation
            and that can offer me great experience in my future field, so why am I not upset that I didn't get any job offers?
            Getting over this depression was a big turning point in my life.
            I stopped putting effort in the wrong areas and started focusing on the right path.
            I was proactively seeking internships for two months, and still am.
            I started go to every single career fair I could find.
            I started going to hackathons and coding bootcamps to network with other software developers and learn new skills.
            I started independently researching different programming languages to expand my programming skills.
            My current internship that I have been with since the beginning of college gives me plenty of opportunities to practice my programming skills
            to help the company.
            I am not upset that I didn't get a fully software development-focused internship this summer because at the end of the day, I did achieve my goal:
            To expand my skills in programming and to set myself on the right path for my future.
        </p>
        <h1>Where Am I Now?</h1>
        <p>Now, my focus is 110% on expanding my programming skills.
            I began this summer only able to code in Java.
            Even then, I did not know how to use Java to create an actual application.
            I could only program simple things that would run on a console.
        </p>
        <p> Now, I am familiar with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
            I am currently learning how to work with ReactJS and databases (Specifically MySQL).
            I have invested in a couple of Udemy courses to guide me as I learn more programming languages and concepts.
            I am also working on a project for my current company.
            The GUI for the project is mostly complete and once I learn more about back-end programming,
            I will be able to link it to a database so that it will be fully functional.
            I plan to work on different projects, one by one, to further expand these skills.
            Hopefully these skills will get me professional employment as a software developer once I graduate from college.
